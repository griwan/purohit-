  Sharing information around HIV testing and related services may elicit feelings of anger, sadness, pain, fear, or discomfort
  When sharing information about HIV, HIV testing, or HIV testing results, prioritize making a safe space that respects everyone’s feelings, actions, and thoughts
  Encourage all individuals, regardless of HIV test results, to speak with their healthcare providers about HIV prevention and treatment services suitable for them
  Terms used to refer to racial and ethnic people in these communities continue to change over time—the terminology used in this program is not exhaustive"
